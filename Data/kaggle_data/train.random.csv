0.0,"""""Our best versus their best...,"""" says Gibbons, whose team blew a big lead, and won only because Betances did another melt-down, walking four of five batters faced, including two with four pitches.  Maybe Gibbons believes that the four Yankee starters on the DL are not among the best, but Castro & Holliday alone are so far superior to the BJ's rubby dubs, I think he ought to go back to his dugout napping and leave the insights to others. Hicks is a pretty good OF, too, while Bird's injury has let to NYY having ten different 1B this season.  And Estrada's vulnerability is back in play, after only a couple of decent outings to remind us of how good he was in 2016. Thank heaven for Pineda's inconsistency, too.

0.0,"I don't believe """"cis"""" and """"trans"""" have substantive content. I do not believe that a male, with male anatomy from head to toe, is a """"woman"""" simply having stated that he identifies as such. I also do not believe that genital mutilation surgery makes a male any more of a woman or vice versa. I simply do not believe it. The scientific community is divided on whether 'transgender' identity issues are rooted in mental illness or not, and of course the sociological and philosophical worlds are sharply divided between postmodernists and realists, the former believing that things like """"man"""" and """"woman"""" are """"social constructs"""" while the latter tend to believe - in my opinion with far greater evidence - that gender identity and biological sex do not vary randomly but in fact tend to match overwhelmingly, with extremely rare exceptions. There is no 'spectrum'.  Long story short I do not believe these new """"identities"""" are legitimate. That is my opinion. Will the law FORCE me to say otherwise now?

0.0,"She won the popular vote - by three million. Why should she just forget and move on? Why should we? Why are you so invested a year later that you write dozens of comments about her if she is so insignificant? She obviously means  a lot to you. She has a valid commentary to make. Her input is important, regardless of what you and others may think. Try as much as you like, but her presence and value to history as the first female Presidential candidate is indelibly set. Why do you want to hush her voice and, by extension, mine? And I don't think she is taking up all the oxygen in the room, either.  Maybe she should try a realty show like Sarah Palin. I might have voted for McCain (maybe) if he hadn't picked the whack job from Alaska as his running mate. But she has certainly benefited financially from that campaign, hasn't she? And she wasn't even as qualified as Hillary Clinton.

0.0,"I am a straight Catholic woman living in community with two gay women, one of them also Catholic. We are all professionals with more than a hundred years of service to the community between us. I know nothing of their """"bedroom activities"""", as Tom Z sums up their identity as gay women. They are not interested in having anyone know anything about their """"bedroom activities"""". Asked about their lives, they speak of the essential work they do in the community (we are a social worker, a doctor and a lawyer) and the loving home life that fills and heals their hearts and souls, allowing them to serve the community the next day. For people like Tom Z, they announce their """"bedroom activities"""" when they introduce themselves as a family. For me, when they identify themselves as a loving family committed to serving the community, they announce the beauty of family and the shared joy of serving the community, EVEN the people who reject them. They are the most Christian, generous women I know.

Area is zoned Residential not Commercial or Industrial which would allow a salvage business to operate.

0.0,"His problem with this lawsuit is based largely on the actions taken by Nest Labs.  Had an employee of Nest Lab become aware of the acts recorded on their system, the company would have been obligated to contact the FBI in any case.  Once aware of the situation, the company had no choice and no duty to allow Patrakis back on the system in case he tried to destroy the evidence.  In fact, the legal guardians of the teenager and child now have a cause of action against Patrakis and will probably use this evidence to sue him to get his assets to pay for the damage done to these children.

0.0,"Most members of a church are not employed by the church, but rather they identify with that particular denomination through a bond of faith.  A corporation is in business as a """"for profit"""" organization, but churches are by and large """"non-profit"""" entities which among other things provide human services to those in need.  People are employed by a corporation because they need to make money to meet their needs and the needs of family members.  Members of faith groups are people who see an obligation to meet the needs of the less fortunate in their communities. Although there are rare exceptions most """"legitimate"""" churches express their faith through works of love and charity.  I do agree with you though that more of the care of the truly needy should be taken on by the private sector because government programs have such enormous waste and they cannot provide the one-one-one care that is the hallmark of private """"non profit"""" organizations.  Your analogy is, indeed, weak.

I really can't explain why not in such a short space, but it has to do with very incorrect interpretations of some archeological finds that don't take into account anything else about their cultures.  There are other reasons Native people were not as creative with technology as Europeans and it's because their worldview and values were different.  Reading what Native people themselves had to say about their own views of their relationship to the world around them is also a source I use to inform my understanding.  What Native people do now doesn't change the historical facts of their cultures.    Historically they could not begin to match the sweeping, destructive plundering of European cultures for the simple reason that they thought the world didn't need changing, not because they couldn't.

Such as raising a cost estimate from $5.2 billion to $6.9 billion only to be told by the FTA that it's more like $8.1  billion.  That makes $5.2 billion and $6.9 billion - """"dubious"""" or """"fake:.  And to choose rail that would entail more than double the cost of Managed Lane makes the choice """"rigged"""".  """"Rigged"""" because the estimated cost of rail  in Chapter 2 of the Environmental Impact Study (Page 2-8) was between $4.192 billion to $6.72 billion and nothing about the yearly cost of rail operations and maintenance which accumulates to billions in its lifetime.

0.0,"Lee being against slavery is pointless.  Its not outrage on my part. Lee was a good general and for his time wasn't a bad man.  However, he did lead troops against the United States and therefor wasn't a great hero.  One good thing for Lee was that he wanted the nation to come together after the war and wasn't in favor of confederate monuments because he thought they kept wounds open.  Many of those monuments were put up by segregationists later because they glorified the old days.  As such they reopened wounds that Lee wished to close.

0.0,"It is not that simple, people can eat & live a perfect healthy lifestyle & still get sick or an illness like Rheumatoid Arthritis.  There is always the question whether a person's illness is caused by environment or genetics.  For some the reason is purely genetic & they will get sick no matter what.   RA is an auto-immune disease & it is genetic but there might be an environmental trigger like vog, stress, poor diet, etc.  Either way there is no real cure for RA just improved treatment for pain and reduce the self-destruction of joints and greatly reduced quality of life.   Better nutrition for everyone is always good but you still need doctors, nurses & a place for people, including the neighbor islands to get treated for various health problems WITHOUT the place going bankrupt.  The neighbor island hospitals when they where run by the State provided that service but went bankrupt using Hawaii tax money & most have been taken over by Queens or Kaiser.   Everything coming down to $$..

0.0,"Waldie once againt doesn't understand what is happening under his nose. To say that Macron's election shows the end of euroskeptic populism is inane. Not only Le Pen's voters belong into that category but also those who voted for Hamon, Melenchon and some minor ones as well. Secondly, Macon's notion of how to reinforce the EU runs smack into the face of the German's deepest held beliefs. Also the Germans want to see some serious restructuring in France before they enter on any more common adventures. So far, Macron hasn't done too well with those unions, in fact no-one ever has. The UK will suffer some turmoil as the negotiations proceed and find a challenging time afterwards. OTOH, they will be spared the disasters that will accompany the eventual breakup of this misconstructed beast the EU.  BTW, why should BR pay for project expenditures in the future?

You did not even try correct these wrongs but rather scream from the grand stands ordering others to act and change. You, as a top 1% earner, have never been charitable to rid our class battles and not even sponsored your domestic servants and direct reports to send their kids to better schools or universities. Instead you wait at the Gupta trough waiting for you hand out.

0.0,"""""...she offers no empirical basis or evidence for her conclusions...regarding the Anglican church!""""  Well, your opinion is not unprecedented. To each his own, especially in a post!  You can read the whole article in ABC RELIGION AND ETHICS, 8 Nov. 2016. Woodhead does base her research on the 2015 British Election Study, which noted that less than a third of UK people identity as Anglican, whose average age is 54; that the Anglican population plunged from 44.5% in 1983 to 19% this past year. Other studies have noted that the 2000 pre-Reformation Churches in England have fewer than 10 worshippers, and 8,000 more can barely muster 20.  Also, we have the warning of the former archbishop of Canterbury, G. Carey: the Church of England is """"a generation away from extinction."""" So I don't think her conclusions have no basis at all; her study makes good  use of the GOVERNMENT charts of decline.

Many people (myself included) thought that the WA lottery was created to fund education, but the bills that were proposed in the 1970's in the WA legislature, did not pass. The first successful move toward dedicating lottery funds for education came on Nov. 7, 2000 when Initiative 728 was approved. This measure redirected part of the lottery revenue to the Student Achievement Fund, which was created by the initiative to reduce class sizes. There have been diversions of those lottery funds to the state's general fund due to projected and real budget short-falls.  Is it possible that the WA State Lottery could be used to fully fund or even have a major impact on education funding in our state? The answer is a resounding """"No""""!

Equal representation of the states in the U.S. Senate is explicitly established in the U.S. Constitution. This feature cannot be changed by state law or an interstate compact.  In contrast, the U.S. Constitution explicitly assigns the power of selecting the manner of appointing presidential electors to the states. The enactment by a state legislature of the National Popular Vote bill is an exercise of a legislature’s existing powers under the U.S. Constitution.  Adding up votes of all voters and winning with the most popular votes is the method that is used in virtually every other election in the country.

These areas hurt the near-term bottom line, but are critical investments in any company's bottom line and success over time.

Only by investor education leading to a demand to separate these two services will the market place provide this separation of the two services. Too often investors are being charged 1-2% of assets under management for portfolio management which is worth perhaps 0.25%, and getting no advice. After 30 years, even at 1% of assets under management, you have lost 25% of your money. Is that fair?

This is a big problem with the US educational system, where international testing indicates the US is down around 23th place in global standings, but most parents think their kids are world class. Then they wonder why companies hire immigrants or move to countries with better educational systems.

Some hospitals in Alaska have bought primary care practices and hired the doctors as employees so the hospital's community can have doctors that will take Medicare.

As far as being used for propaganda purposes this latest chemical assault assault on Syrian civilians is not an isolated incident. As I said, there have been 9 such attacks this year alone.  There has been long standing agreement that their use was beyond the pale - something the Syrians conceded when they agreed to """"destroy"""" their arsenal.

The Quran only mentions female dressed code, there is no mention of male dressed code except for facial hair. If you review pictures from the Middle East, back around the 1900's you will notice most females did not wear these outfits. Some Muslim countries ban facial coverings. I understand the burka originated in Afghanistan before AD to control the movement of females who were treated as property, sold and traded.  The burka in the hilling rocky areas prevented the female from seeing and running away. Why would anyone continue such a repressive dress code? In my opinion, Muslims wearing any face coverings are making a political statement not a religious statement.

We have the rule of law (thank god), we have very just laws rooted in a wonderful Charter, and we have a police force to enforce laws. All good. But unfortunately, some (<I said some) persons in police culture have poor regard for aboriginal victims of crime, sexual assault victims, persons of colour (cf. racial profiling & harassment), and sometimes LGBTQ persons. It's been proven that many departments have too high a percentage of masculinist, abusive, code-of-silence types. If Pride wants to send a message that it's bothered by all of that by excluding police for a while, good on them. It's obvious that Pride's decision does not reflect a disrespect for laws generally.

If they had, it would have been fascinating to see how John Paul responded.  My personal opinion is that John Paul had the traditional old world mindset about church-state relations, which would be natural for a prelate from a communist country. I think he believed that, always and everywhere, the church must be protected from the state. So if a bishop is in danger of prosecution in his home country, you get him out, no questions asked.  The problem, of course, is that sometimes the state isn't the bad guy. There's a big difference between a bishop being imprisoned due to lack of religious freedom in China and one on the lam because he dropped the ball on child protection in the U.S. But, sadly, I don't think John Paul was able to make that distinction.

And don't forget that the entire Establishment has come out AGAINST Trump, and FOR Hillary.

Harper should most certainly have acted after the first SCC ruling against the federal government but he tried to ignore it as he did the second too! It was only when Federal Court warned him that the government HAD to action the SCC rulings that he acted and even then he dumped Khadr into a high security pen far from his family. Irrespective of what Chretien might have done, Harper's actions made Khadr's case far stronger and an award inevitable.

While farmers still have income they need to start to make the capital investments needed. Instead of $100k for a tractor they need to invest that capital in a bioreactor with state and federal help.

The EC is an old device put into the constitution to allow Southern states to have presidents elected. That includes Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, all slave owners. The Constitution gave each slave 3/5ths of a human existence in counting for representation in the EC, even though none could vote in a presidential election. Neither could white males who owned no real estate, though their numbers were also counted. In no way was that a democratic republic, though it did get the country off to a good start and reward the most prominent advocates for independence, which was otherwise not universally desired.

As a tax payer I will gladly pay for the police work, the prosecution, court expense, and incarceration expense for theft. Penalty for theft must be many times greater than any gains. When you steal you take the amount of life and energy that someone expended to acquire the item that you take. The expense of police work, prosecution, court, and prison for a personal choice drug crime is in effect a property crime (taking tax money) imposed on the tax payers by the judge and the government.

I do not think the Church has to remain as it has always been, especially when it isn't working to provide a spirit filled life to the 99% of Catholics who are not part of the ruling apparachnik.  The ideas of the bishops equating to the Apostles was and is an attempt to make linkages between the way the Church structured itself and how Christ dealt with the Apostles, but it is not the only way that relationship can be viewed.  I think the formation of the organization mirrored how power and authority were lived out in the times just after Jesus lived and for centuries later.   Just because """"we have always done it that way"""" doesn't mean it is a good way, especially now.  Those times are not these times.  The Curia is less a problem if power is decentralized.  But the bishops ruling as minor despots accountable to no one - that is still a problem.  So is the all male, patriarchical church.  Time to hear women's voices.

First, the analysis of Canada's net debt to GDP.  In measuring net debt the federal government includes the value of CPP, QPP and other pension plans as assets to offset liabilities.  Since the assets of the pension plans belong to the contributors, it is fraudulent (if the government was a private corporation) to include these asset as their own. Second, governments use private sector to fund projects  at higher interest rates to shift the risk to the private sector.  Ontario  has saved millions using alternative financing.

Still waiting for anyone to take the challenge and explain how a guy goes from being a slave owner to American hero just because he speaks out against a President that you don't like.

But the fact is, the majority of parents don't have the background to help their kids with more than basic material.  It's not that uncommon for parents to be completely baffled by their kids' math homework - and that's even at the grade school level.  On a humourous note, one of my colleagues was complaining about this very thing.  His oldest was in grade 7 and, while he could help the kids with his homework (he's a qualified actuary with a degree in math) he said that other parents were complaining but the school wouldn't do anything.  So three of us sat down with one of the questions from his son's homework and decided to construct the most ridiculous solution we could come up with.  Given that the three of us had six math degrees among us (including a PhD and two MSc's) and six actuarial designations we were having fun.

How many mothers-in-law actually live in one? I've never even heard of one. These are used as income boosters for the homeowner. Yes, higher density is achieved, but in so doing, the peace and tranquility of neighboring families that wish to enjoy their gardens for the tranquil customary retreats such spaces originally are designed for--- is lost.

And then the results came in, and surprise, the voters were thinking different.  Now we have a race where the challenger, having expended all of his ideas, needs to come up with new ones, and fast. In my opinion, unless he comes out with a blockbuster idea  - like finding a billion bucks to cover the expenses that is guaranteed money in the bank, Djou has nothing more to move the needle in my opinion.

Crimea's democratically-elected government organized a referendum to rejoin Russia (as they'd been trying to do for over 25 years). After the referendum was successful, Crimea's government applied for accession to Russia. Crimea was an unbound region at that time, not a part of Ukraine, as Ukraine had ceased to exist as a legal or constitutional entity when its constitution was rendered null and void in February 2014 - meaning, there were no Ukrainian laws, and no Ukrainian territory.

When he was covered by workplace benefits he had access to affordable dental care but had to significantly reduce this care after retiring. As he told me, the removal of his teeth was simply a financial consideration. All the money that went into dental care over several decades was essentially wiped away because this province (Ontario) and country can't or won't set up an affordable system to ensure that its seniors get such care.

It was, however, surprising and disappointing, since the bill had a wide support among legislators and the public. If the bill moved out of conference, we, the public, would still need to vote on it to amend the constitution.  As far as taxes go – this bill would have not affected the vast majority of Hawaii residents who do not own several rental properties. It would have, however, asked rich inventors to contribute their fair share to fund our public schools.

The national Case-Shiller HPI inflation rate for May was 5.6%, with Zillow Real Estate Research forecasting 5.3% for June. The US Fed has not given any indication that it actually targets a 2% inflation rate. From January 2012 forward, the average annualized inflation rate has been just under 1.2%.

It was an informative article but really doesn't add anything new to the discussion.  The fact is that benefits for PERS Tier 1 beneficiaries are going to handicap this state in the provision of services for the next thirty to forty years.  PERS will continue to dominate all of our public discussions about state finances.  The Supreme Court of Oregon has upheld the contractual rights of beneficiaries to receive the benefits they were promised regardless of the implications.  All public monies must first be applied towards the obligation to these beneficiaries.   When a public body establishes a budget the costs for PERS contributions come right off the top.  Then the agency figures out how to make do with what is left.  Usually that means cuts in services.  The hands of our leaders are largely tied when it comes to this issue.

Osweiler and Lynch are big enough and enjoy the contact of delivering the blow first, but they need to learn first off how to slide too and extend their career.

He talked about improving healthcare, lowering taxes, getting rid of drug dealers, getting the best deal possible in trade deals, helping veterans, improving the military and fixing the infrastructure etc.. Yes he is still Trump, and is erratic, unpredictable and possibly dangerous, but it's hard to argue with some of the points in today's speech. What was interesting and where the media come into play is the Sweden incident . He pointed out quite rightly how the press jumped all over him for that, yet when shortly after there were riots in the Muslim section of a city in Sweden it wasn't carried by the press. Certainly this paper carried extensive coverage of Trump's comments on Sweden, but declined to mention the riots. Trump will not back down with the press, and neither will the press

Whereas JFK & Krushchev knew the horrors of war and used deft diplomatic maneuvering to resolve the Cuban Missile Crisis,  the North Korean Missile Crisis is being dealt with by men who relish open confrontation and each stridently refuses to compromise on the issue of DPRK de-nuclearization.

It demonstrated how even a short-term, reasoned act on the part of Trump would be spun as an act of sheer evil by his enemies, including the MSM.  Of the six countries included in Trump's temporary immigration ban, the USA is  currently making war in four of them. The other two are not what you'd call friendly to America. Are all those countries predominantly Muslim? Yes. Regardless, the security concern is glaringly obvious. And it's the US president that's specifically tasked with ensuring the security of the country.  Trump's 90-day ban on immigration from those countries, in order to conduct a close review of America's immigration policies, was eminently sensible. It was enacted within the president's mandate and of short duration only. An easy score for Trump.

But England was looking for an excuse as the Germans had the audacity to get involved in a naval Dreadnought race with England.

Her fans  couldn't accept the results of the vote and she did nothing to try and stop that 'fake' speculation, in fact she actually joined the 'resist' movement, encouraging her fan base to do everything they could to stop Trump.  The truth is, Hillary/aka """"Johnny"""" did do it and did get away with it, thanks to James Comey. Trump is not trying to get away with anything, he is defending himself against an avalanche of horse manure from the left and he needs lots of shovels.

0.0,"Based on what we hear during the public meetings, we are convinced developers are fighting very hard against anything new they are asked to do (increased spacing, setbacks), while they are very eager to get everything they can that would benefit them immensely in terms of code changes (height, density). Developers make their money and residents suffer with the consequences! Why are height/density increases needed right away in the downtown area while there are still many properties available for development in transit oriented places such as Wilberton, Spring District, Overlake, Eastlake that can accommodate significant growth, while downtown is getting saturated.  It is not clear to us if the total impact of the height/density increases are well understood. Why are these zoning decisions being rushed without understanding the full impact of the zoning changes? The total effect is yet to be fully studied and understood, such as the impact on traffic. Let's not become another Seattle!!!

That means Catholic husbands are also part of the decision.  Still, for a woman who wants a career along with a family it is a decision that impacts her the most.  Same for a woman who simply does not have the health to bear child after child - as is true for many women in my family for several generations.  Contraceptives and sterilizations can be life savers.  There is nothing wrong with women/couples choosing to use NFP and for Mom to stay home with the children.  But, it is not a choice all women want to make and contraceptives make it possible for other choices to be made.  Being a non-working Mom is also not a decision that all Moms can make.

The money would be better spent on the ground troops who ignite the back burns and clear the fuels. I say this having fought fire and worked on preventive fuel reduction projects.

In fact NATO assets and allied aircraft were deployed multiple times to target Serbia forces. This multilateralism  gave the bombing  an element of legitimacy which the current attack does not.  In the Syria case - Trump informed US allies but did not seek out their support or try to achieve consensus. Really a full blown unilateral action.  2) The Kosovo bombing campaign  was in lieu of a ground war which Wesley Clark then SACEUR preferred. But more importantly it had a specific purpose - not to punish but to eliminate the threat Serbia forces posed to the Kosovars (even if faked).  In the Syria case Trump's only purpose appears to be to punish and deter. But in terms of eliminating Assad's capability a ground war is necessary.

My skepticism of this type of announcement remains, however, because the deadline is so far in the future that no one will remember the pledge when it comes due, and without fossil fuel and hydro maxed out, the source of continuous dependable power remains to be identified.

0.0,"Hmm.  Thirty-five years ago, in a case known as Seneca College v. Bhadauria, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that one can't sue in court based on a breach of the Human Rights Code.  Since then, the appropriate forum (for a non-union employee) is to use Human Rights Tribunals.  To the best of my knowledge, class action law suits based solely on Human Rights violations don't escape this ruling.  The Ontario Human Rights Code allows a limited right to sue, depending on whether there are other non-civil rights claims in the suit.  I'm not aware that the Canadian Human Rights Act has a similar provision.

He's away from the friendly practices and now facing the number 1's of opponents and adjusting to the speed and the hits. Passes don't always come out like they should like the INT he tossed. The O-line will take a long time to really become dependable and easy on the penalties. All in all I'd have to say things look promising just like the story headlined. I would love to see the Bronco backs coming in and out of the lineup all game long, running as well as catching the ball. 15-20 carries for CJ and 10-15 touches for Jamaal and the others.

Because Christianity is a true religion of peace, Christians turn the other cheek even under the greatest duress. By giving legal protection specifically to one of the most odious, violent and oppressive ideologies in human history, the government of Canada is will only help to embolden its most bloodthirsty adherents. Canada will become like Germany, a failed democracy in which criminal charges are laid against people for making even the most tepid criticism of the crescent moon death cult. Christians and Jews in particular will end up like their counterparts in France - living in an environment of increasing fear and persecution with no government authority dedicated to their protection. If the House of Commons passes the """"anti-Islamophobia"""" bill, it will mark the death of freedom in this country. Canada will join the ranks of the West's dead and dying democracies.

Those traits may work in reality TV but they are not suitable for the leader of our nation and the commander in chief of our military.  In fact, they are downright dangerous in our complex world.

Hamilton wrote in The Federalist Papers No. 68: """"The process of election affords a moral certainty, that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications. Talents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity, may alone suffice to elevate a man to the first honors  The vote was limited to white men who owned property.

On hand that day in 1948 among 3,000 Baltimoreans were the generals' grandchildren, the governor and the mayor, Thomas D'Alesandro Jr., who brought along his 8-year-old daughter. You may know her today as Nancy Pelosi. The statue was placed in a park across the street from the Baltimore Museum of Art and Johns Hopkins University. Baltimore was below the Mason-Dixon line, but Maryland, a war-torn slave state, never seceded from the Union. (John Wilkes Booth was from Maryland.) A retirement home near Baltimore for Confederate soldiers closed in 1932.

As such, aren't the lobbyists the one's that are not following the rules rather than the party in this case?  Shouldn't they or the corporation be going back to the party after being reimbursed and then asking for the donation to be correctly attributed?

Without this infrastructure our economic growth would have been nowhere near as 'great'.  Eventually when our (regulated) phone system (with Faxes) and some healthy competition showed up, the post office was privatized, but this did not mean all the special laws that relate to the post office went away.  Some of these are still very valuable for our infrastructure, but they do place a burden on the post office.

Just like Barack Obama, and every president before both of them. Melania Trump is married to Donald Trump, and what Donald wants, he makes sure he gets. But, every indication, IMO, is that Melania Trump wanted nothing to do with Donald Trump's run for office. As another example, if Melania Trump wanted Barron Trump to finish out the school year in New York City before moving to the White House, what business is that of ours?

Pro-life people are in favor of using the courts to advance these sorts of situations when the person or relatives want to discontinue life support.  The Schiavo case comes to mind.

The congregation decides on all aspects of policy and there isn't a higher body like the diocese or an authority like the Pope to get them to toe the line.  This is where you have read the resolution wrong looking from a lense of a top-down organization. There have been SBC Congregations that have called women as pastors and teachers.  The congregation decides also when to dismiss the pastor and make for a call for another. And the SBC National Office has no say in determining the local congregation selection as pastor.

Milk consumption continues to drop while fewer milk farmers make more money and cry about paying tax and of course everything is about the average Canadian. If we want a better dairy industry and more jobs we should loosen up the rules about who can produce and market milk, specially small producers of special products such as whole milk for consumption and cheese, this goes for all farm products.

Of course they also received loans and assistance from other nations, such as France. Marx and Engels did not invent the income tax.  They were also Germans and had the book printed in London.  It was about workers rights and leaned toward a socialist society.  Now obviously you have always lived in a state where there have never been income taxes, right?  Didn't think so.  I was a blue collar worker my whole life and paid state, federal and even local taxes.  I have lived in Alaska almost fifty years.  I support a state income tax.

Generally those exposed to diversity are more tolerant than those who aren't as those living in non-diverse areas are more susceptible to negative stereotypes.

Why didn't the legal system just vacate the conviction? And why did the Four accept the deal where they will NOT pursue a wrongful conviction suit if they were really wrongfully convicted??? 18 years is a long time to spent in prison for a crime you did not commit, something is owed to you, eh?

Bill brought us a surplus budget, no troops in foreign wars and considerable entertainment.

0.0,"The author seems very confident in dismissing Iran's stated reason for launching a satellite into space, but he does not use facts to justify his conclusion that the most recent launch is part of a nuclear-tipped ICBM program.  Contrary to his assertion, launching satellites is not a """"perfect way to learn"""" all of the necessary precursors to an effective ICBM capability.  Most  conspicuously, it does nothing to assist in developing a warhead that can successfully re-enter the atmosphere.  It should also be incumbent on the author to explain why Iran's considerable missile development efforts in recent years have been focused on improving the survivability and accuracy of its short- and medium-range missiles -- not extending their range.

It seems to me the items that come by ferry from a distance would need to be unloaded in Juneau, put on a truck there (OK, boost for Juneau employment, but not Haines or Skagway), driven the treacherous road, wait for a ferry to cross over to Haines, be driven onto the ferry individually rather than one truck shuttling several trailers as is done now, since there won't be time to """"take turns"""", cross over Lynn Canal, then be unloaded. So, perhaps things that come by ferry now would have to come by barge instead, REDUCING ferry income. Plus those trucks would take up a lot of space on the smaller """"crossing"""" ferries.  So...I need the description of the source of this freight cost reduction.

0.0,"Look at the article it is about LEGAL immigration and talks about regulation-- which my post says I support. My point is that it regulation is good, but cutting numbers of immigrants is bad for our country and our economy because of our falling birth rate among non-immigrants. The result is older people with fewer children, and those fewer children are also having fewer children in a trend that cannot be stopped once it is established since so many women are past child bearing age and they are adding to the older population. With fewer women to have children, and smaller percentage of young supporting large percentage of old dependents like Japan. What has saved us from going over the edge like Japan is large numbers of legal immigrants who are having more children than Americans. Without immigrants we end up like Japan, South Korea, Germany and other places in Western Europe-- a nation with a high percentage of elders-- mostly women.

Although we may see an initial decrease in property taxes (truly to be believed only once I actually see it), the assembly will find a way to creep that rate back up to current levels and beyond. That's the problem with a multiple tax strategy (or advantage if you're a big-spending politician), you only see them one at a time so when each is raised it doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but when you look at them as a whole they turn out to be a big chunk of one's income. I'm sure the mayor and assembly will be pushing a sales tax next.

Preferential ballots also make sense, though I would prefer a second round run-off election between the two candidates who polled the best in the first round. That allows you to vote with your heart in the first round and with your head in the second. One system that makes increasingly less sense in a polarizing world is proportional representation. The NDP has cited the success of that system, pointing to places and times where there was societal consensus, like Western Europe after WWII. Unfortunately, there are a host of examples of how poorly PR works in divided societies: Israel struggles to form coalitions and ends up beholden to the radical policies of tiny parties; the Netherlands struggles to maintain its half millennium tradition of tolerance, and then there was Weimar.

In 1998 Scout Venturing was initiated, can and often is, coed which has the added benefit of youth learning to work together as they will find adult life - men and women in workplace and social contexts.  It serves those youth that want a different Scouting experience or one at all in the case of the girls. It also allows participation in Scouts to Age 21 vs to 18 Boy Scouts.

But make no mistake about it, Aislin, blood transfusions DO SAVE LIVES. And often times a lack of one COSTS LIVES TO BE LOST, UNNECESSARILY, Aislin.  Of course I know JWs refuse blood because they are told to do so by the GB (due to a clear misreading of the bible) and not because of health risks. But JWs like you and others still try to present them as dangerous which is simply untrue.

South Africa is now more racist than it has ever been and this is so sad. There is so many poor and this is so sad; waiting for the ANC to deliver on promises that they clearly never will makes the situation even wore.

From the articles I've read on this story it seems like having workplace meetings in a hotel room is an accepted practice in the entertainment business. This is very uncommon in the industry I work in, and i've spent more time in hotels for work then I wish I had. Any decent hotel has a restaurant or conference rooms that are specifically set up for business meetings. There is absolutely no excuse for anyone to have a business meeting in a hotel room and the union should strictly enforce this.  Regarding the union: You are paying dues so that you can work in a safe environment. End of story. If your union cant enforce that then there is something wrong with the union and you may need to go to your provincial or federal labour ministry to get it sorted out.

Set your initial rent at the top end and high enough to help make up for that loss of a month's rent.  Having said that, the one month free can be a bit galling for some landlords.  My neighbour had to evict his tenants because of a stolen goods/drug ring they had set up.  He gave two months notice, including one month free.  They trashed the place well beyond the damage deposit.  He was too afraid to go to court as he was afraid of gang retribution.  The landlord/tenant act has few protections if you get bad tenants.

If we look at the typical family in the 1960s , one income could support a whole family. If we fast forward to today the same lifestyle requires 2 incomes and there are far fewer children per family. Of course we cannot go back to those times as the nature of work has changed due to technology and the family dynamic is so different after the sexual revolution. However why is that despite incredible advances in productivity and technology that the possibility of the Canadian dream seems more and more remote especially looking at the young who are now graduating to face quite often the prospect of internships instead of paying jobs. Even if we strip away the vacations to Mexico and iphones the ability for a young Canadian couple to have secure employment and a decent home becomes more and more difficult with each passing year.

No business, or Government can succeed without an economy where there is disposable income. When people spend money all businesses do better. When you operate from a supply side you sequester currency in a few places, instead of distribution throughout the business community. Let the people spend their money where they want and allow demand side economics the opportunity th help the state, instead of supporting a bloated Government that is losing constituents on a daily basis.

If you belong to an Anglican Church that has almost an indistinguishable theology of the Sacraments from that of the Catholic Church, then, quite obviously you will see the priesthood similarly to how we Catholics see priesthood.  It is difficult, I realize to talk about what """"Protestants"""" believe because there are so many sects that believe contradictory things and varied things.  However, in general, Protestants and Catholics do not see what it means to be clergy in the same way.  They are very different.

Tell me how does one meet the federal requirements for education for a village with 9 children without spending plane loads of money sending equipment and paying individuals to stay in those remote locations? A teacher in town teaches 35 per class times 6 or 7 classes of kids weekly, one in the village sees a handful all day but by contract gets the same pay.

The fact is that not only is the ANC very bad at running a modern economy (due to its unprogressive and outdated ideology, it could do much better for the poor), but it has also failed badly in its core activity, running a decent covert corruption operation.

Along came V2 and overnight the Mass changed considerably; that which could never be changed; changed. With the New Mass the Catholic Church shot itself in the foot: if the unchangeable Mass could after all be changed beyond recognition then every other 'unchangeable' dogma and doctrine was also up for debate. Very few Catholics were aware of what went on at V2 but the reordering of Churches and the new Mass signified that a sea change had occurred in Catholicism: Modernists were in the ascendency: a new broom was 'sweeping clean' thousands of years of Catholic belief.

The blended bus rail pass will likely be in the $120 to $165 range with the long haul busses,  $90-120 without, due to how badly lowballed and inept planning and execution has been on the Corrupt Rail System.

When you compare the income level of a liberal arts graduate who is a Manager at a local fast food restaurant or at the local car rental franchise to a journeyman electrician, that emphasis is wrong.  Just because I picked up a couple of degrees at Duck U and was able to at least 'feed the bulldog' in careers based on that doesn't mean that I must genuflect every time I see 'college degree' mentioned.   A high school student needs to be given enough information to be able to make an informed personal career choice, not just aimed at the one his/her teachers chose.  I was totally bored with Shakespeare and Physics and  Advanced Placement Math and other college prep courses.  It didn't mean I couldn't regurgitate the stuff the teachers wanted; it just wasn't interesting.   Many young males have the same problem.

We Alaskans Kiss snowy Alaska winters goodbye Author: Miranda Weiss   Updated: September 28   Published January 3 HOMER — I took last winter personally, the months of snowless dark. And I had none of my usual outlets for surviving — or thriving — in the cold. Local ski trails were grassy. Walking routes were glazed in ice. Without snow, I ran out of ways to coax my children outside so that we all wouldn't go crazy. I unfurled an old tarp across our steep, green backyard and sent them down it in sleds. That held their interest for 30 minutes.  I'd always bragged to folks Outside that in Alaska we enjoyed a """"reliable"""" winter.

There is no correlation between legalized cannabis and an increase in pornography studios or prostitution.  Then, he went on to state how shameless his life is and that God favors him and disfavors others. Jesus spoke to a lot of people, and the ones he passed judgement to were the ones casting judgement on others. That's it. He didn't judge sinners, or decide who's sin is better or worse. He taught that we're all sinners and only God is good. He didn't try to change sin through law, he tried to change the world through example and love.

The amount of this subsidy is based on the finances of the athletic department, or entertainment division as you put it. If salaries were under control, and contract guarantees reduced, this subsidy could go away. The justification for this transfer and the salaries/guarantees is that athletics does help generate tuition revenue and donations by an amount exceeding the subsidy. I guess I would put it that the motivations of the two groups (academic and athletic) may differ but it is not clear that both stakeholders have an appropriate say in the decision process.  I would hazard that the financial aspects of a decision weigh less than they should over in athletics. The long contract guarantee here was easy to make in part because athletics knows they will always be bailed out by someone--say, academic money or Phil.

Of course this wouldn't have been possible without an oil industry here.  So that's why when considering the right amount of tax credits it is a balancing game - likely a more delicate balancing game this day and age. A spirit of cooperation between government and industry is what brought oil production here in the first place. We have to be careful and sometimes prudent, but careful thought is what we need to determine what is right for the industry and state. Foster cooperation so the state can enjoy the next 40 years like we  at least close to the way Alaska did in the previous 40.

More buses means more traffic on surface streets around the rail stations.  I've rode a westside express bus to downtown for the last 28 years.  I've done my part in trying to alleviate traffic congestion.  Once rail goes into operation, my Tesla 3 on order will autonomously drive me in to work from Mililani.  Everyone else that I've talked to on the express will also drive.  That means more traffic on the freeway.  You are wrong, with rail it is more expensive to own an automobile.  Didn't you read the article?  Downtown parking rates is rising DUE TO RAIL.  Vehicle taxes are increasing DUE TO RAIL.  It took me 38 minutes on my AM commute this morning via Express bus.  Mr. Boots, please enlighten us as to how your rail system will improve my commute since we are projected as 90% of the rail ridership? ...crickets...

Remove that component, and the rate falls substantially.  As well, approx. 1.6 Million Canadians visit Mexico annually, and a large number, easily in the 10's of thousands, live here full time. What is the murder rate of Canadians in Mexico, assuming the average stay is 2 weeks per person?....Then, factor out the bozos who come here to for the drugs and/or otherwise engage in extremely risky behavior.

If you invest $100,000 in a five year (safe) bond, in five years you receive your $100,000 back. That is referred to as the bond maturing at par. Between now and then (over the five-year period) that bond could be worth $80,000 or $110,000, more or less. The price tha the bond trades at will fluctuate up and down with various factors that cause supply and demand to change. However, smeone who bought this bond to hold for the five-year term (and I realize how difficult that may be from a trader's point of view to understand but people actually do this---invest for the full five year term) can and likely will totally ignore these price fluctuations. After all, they are meaningless to someone with this objective of buying for the term of the bond. Regardless of what happens during the term of the bond, the destination remains the same.

0.0,"Second quote:  Ex-queen Liliuokalani confided to then Senator George Hoar (R.

""""Autobiography of Seventy Years"""" by George Frisbie Hoar (C. Scribner's Sons, 1903).  To find that quote from Lili'uokalani, look for """"Lili'uokalani"""" in the index to Hoar's book.  See also William Adam Russ, """"The Hawaiian Republic"""" (1894-98) (Associated University Press, London and Toronto 1992).  On page 331, Russ quotes Senator Hoar as quoting those words of Liliuokalani.  If anyone claims that Senator Hoar was lying, or falsely quoting Liliuokalani, we should note that Senator Hoar was Liliuokalani's strongest ally in the Senate at the time the Treaty of Annexation was introduced in 1897 and the anti-annexation petition was introduced.

Here in Canada Amway told its dealers to do the same thing with Tory Convention Delegate meetings, actually succeeding in some, such as Kamloops. They wanted a Tory PM who would kill the Tax Evasion case against top Amway execs.  Whatever else you can say about the Reform Party and the Conservative Reform Alliance Party they did away with the Delegate selection farce and went to direct vote among Party members.

Andrew had a fairly warped image of John previously as witnessed in the election campaign when he spent more time attacking the NDP than he did the BC Liberals.  I suspect he was the only member of the Green team willing to consider partnering with Christy, and may be one reason he brought in Conservative  Norman Spector as an advisor during the negotiations. After spending more time with Horgan, I suspect Andrew and his colleagues discovered Horgan true nature as a very decent person whose primary interest in politics seems to be to serve others and seek more social justice, not self aggrandizement - which has been the primary purpose of the incumbent and her predecessor, as their's was certainly not social justice. Keep up the co-operative spirits and good will Green and NDP MLA's!  BC deserves it and needs it.

You, as a geologist, should know that there have been many major extinctions in Earth's history (not human history). One of these, the Permian extinction, almost destroyed ALL life on earth. Most of these extinctions involved climate change; the Permian was probably caused by CO2 release from a supervolcano.  It is hard for us to understand that we are now numerous and pervasive enough to have a profound impact on the planet's biosphere. For most of our history we have been too few, and too poor, to have an impact. With our population now approaching the 10s of billions, the mindset that served us well for the past 800 centuries is no longer valid. We can and are impacting the environment, and our waste products are tipping the balance.  This is far too deep a subject to discuss exhaustively here.

There is no reason to keep more than two or three years of pension obligations invested in fixed income assets. There is also zero justification to invest in foreign stocks. That diversification argument was destroyed years ago. If the US stock market catches a cold, the rest of the world will be coming down with double pneumonia.  This ain't rocket science.

I would suggest the first item on Mr Sigh's agenda should be to educate Canadians about his religion, and religions in general, most Canadians are totally ignorant of other religions (and often don't even know much about their own).  Too many people confuse Hinduism and Sikhism, or Sikhism and Islam, and don't realize Sikhism was actually founded in reaction to Islam and Hinduism, rejecting caste and female subjugation.  Although demanding a rather austere lifestyle from practitioners, it does not attempt to convert others, preaches love and tolerance, and social equality.

The concentration camps were  set up and all  the leading opponents of the Nazis, especially Socialists, Communists, union leaders, journalists and others  who opposed Hitler were imprisoned..  Everything-- the courts, schools, media were taken over by the Nazis; the military had to pledge personal loyalty to Hitler, etc. All of this happened without any reference to guns or gun laws, they had nothing to do with creating this totalitarianism.

I would be happy to present the facts in debate with Gunnar Knapp, to prove that Alaska is being fleeced any time, any place. It is public knowledge that Gunnar's predecessor at ISER, Dr. Goldsmith, ignored the same questions and received a big check from oil interests to produce his report supporting the big giveaway of SB-21. The oil industry bought our legislature, and the  institutions created to educate Alaskans on issues important to the prudent management of state owned resources.

The college regulates the fraternities including careful control of the pledging.

Though I feel that my son might have been more successful academically if he hadn't tried to depend so much on the help of his frat brothers with his classes. On the other hand, his frat brothers still, seven years later, provide friendship, support, and professional networking. Perhaps more universities need to look at a model, such as Rose-Hulman, and see that fraternities can be controlled and do not need to be allowed to run amok with such serious consequences. Part of it is that Rose-Hulman, ranked as one of the top engineering schools in the country, puts academics as its highest priority.

Why?  - There's lots of government money flying around that they can vacuum up. - They are hedging their bets in case the green revolution really does happen (not likely IMO). - It's good PR and makes them appear forward-thinking to people who haven't studied the issues very hard.  But most importantly, renewables are intermittent sources of power. They need standby capacity that can kick in quickly when the wind/sun/etc dies off. The more renewable power, the more standby capacity is needed. And the crucial fact is, standby power sources tend to be fossil fuels: gas, oil and coal (where permitted) — since they have the easiest time adjusting output.  So it's not hard to see why fossil fuel interests might support renewables, knowing their business is guaranteed right up until renewables can completely replace all other sources of power (i.e., never).

0.0,"It’s an interesting article but is biased in that it fails to point out the drawbacks of wind power - mainly that it is not a reliable source (since wind is not constant) and that it has a high cost of both implementation and maintenance as well as a short infrastructure life and that it is not without it’s own environmental impact. Its possible that wind farms are becoming economically competitive in the UK which has one of the highest costs of electricity in the world. If we accept that (in doing so we ignore the UK’s massive government subsidies of the industry) it does not mean that they will be competitive in Canada in a country where electricity costs are a fraction of the UK costs. Canadians are not prepared to triple their electricity price in order to move away from Hydro which is the cheapest, cleanest and least environmentally damaging source in the world.

Existing dope grow licenses in Oregon are capable of growing six times the present market demand.  And there are twice that number of license applications and weed amounts in the hopper.  So it looks like 97% of the potential home for Oregon grown weed will not be a legal market at this time.  If Oregon enforces its laws,  it cuts is tax take from weed,  and it will incur a lot of legal expenses prosecuting miscreants.  It is a lose-lose scenario.

0.0,"No, a reduction to 35 mph likely won't help much. The relationship between death and life relative to the speed of the car that strikes someone is a very steep curve from 20 mph to 30 mph. Over 30 mph, almost everyone dies; below 20 mph, almost everyone lives. A speed reduction actually aimed at saving pedestrian lives would have reduced the speed limit to 25 mph. In an ODOT world, where roadway deaths are up something like 40% over the past two years (yes, that's higher than the miles driven were up and much higher than the national numbers were up), safety always takes a back seat to speed.  Realistically, the only way to reduce deaths in that corridor is to lower the speed much more, probably by reducing the number and width of lanes. In this sedentary culture, that's not likely to happen. We'd rather die and kill than have safe transportation infrastructure, and that's too bad.

They have less motivation to speak reasonably or listen reasonably.  The goal is to provoke.  The suggestion is instead of being provoked to just ignore their nonsense.

0.0,"The toll was an attempt by Tory to make a cash grab from hardworking people outside his constituency. The argument that it was going to reduce congestion if true could also mean that it would reduce business revenue from already over taxed downtown businesses because people will find alternatives to going downtown. By the same argument the toll could also drive businesses to the 905. The Gartner and DVP are life lines into the city and the people travelling them that don't live in the city are also benefitting the city by working for or spending money at businesses that pay taxes to, you guessed it,  the city. The cost of these life lines and projects like public transit that will decrease the congestion is a cost that should be shared by all not just non 416ers.

But you're right that the cycle was set up for a GOP win this time. The fact that Trump barely eked one out -- and only by virtue of the Electoral College -- is a testament to how unattractive a candidate he truly was.  I know we don't see it the same way, but from what I've heard from most of the people I know who voted for Trump, it was more about their dislike of Hillary than love for him. Rightly or wrongly (mostly wrongly, IMHO), she came to represent for these people the Washington establishment and decades of Washington establishment corruption. That baggage would have been with her regardless of her opponent. Heck, it even haunted her in the primaries, both in 2016 and in 2008 against Obama -- and that was before Benghazi and the emails.

Statistically sound studies show that NPs practicing without adequate physician supervision order more inappropriate tests, refer to specialists less appropriately, and cost patients and hospitals more money.  Far from trying to """"protect their turf,"""" as NPs enjoy saying about doctors (without any evidence back that claim), physicians have actually been silently trying to """"clean up the mess"""" made of our veterans' medical care by primary NPs as those veterans eventually come across our path in the current system.

0.0,"Wow, talk about conflating.The false narrative Marxist politicians use that lower taxes reduces Government income is the crux of the discussion, Reagan's virtually cutting taxes in half while doubling the revenue obviously debunked that non-sense. The tax increases in the 1980 were due to crushing inflation with no growth, AKA stagflation. Inflation increased people taxes due to the progressive (aptly named) tax system while their real income stayed the same reducing their spendable income further stifling growth. The 1990's and the massive expansion in our economy naturally increased tax revenue and gave Clinton the first balanced budget which of course Democrats and Rhino's quickly overcame. JFK first used voodoo economics to overcome his first 2 years of economic chaos so I guess you are denigrating him, correct?

If they are held in a non-reg account (and it looks as though that's the case) then, yes, there is 15% withholding but it's a moot point since someone with income of $75k would recover it all via the Foreign Tax Credit.  To my mind, the only area where the U.S. withholding tax comes into play is for U.S. dividend paying stocks held in a non-retirement registered plan - TFSA, RESP or RDSP. There the withholding tax is not recoverable.  But even there, depending upon one's investment goals and risk tolerance, it can make sense to hold U.S. dividend paying stocks - for example, i hold two in my TFSA.

Yes, trash haulers will drive more, but the increase is marginal at best, and wait times at Short Mountain will be no longer, and more likely much less, than at Glenwood. This will also transfer the cost of trash hauling to the user, rather than the general taxpayer. It will, to a small extent, reduce the amount of time load on city streets, with a somewhat minimal reduction in additional road damage caused by the heavy axle loads of full trash vehicles. Finally, it will permit the County to sell or redevelop that large Glenwood transfer station, which will have both tax and economic development benefits to the county and both cities. No, it won't reduce taxes, but keep in mind the County has been unable to fund many services because of budget issues. The question is how will this better enable them to meet citizens needs.

Repealing it will make it possible for the Seattle King County Public Health Department to site it anywhere they please. The judge's ruling on I-27 provides us insight. In a public health emergency, the public health  officer through the Public Health Board has incredible power. Please remember the Tylenol tampering case (removed a product from drug store shelves) and Jack in the Box e-coli  (shut down businesses). The county ordinance, thanks to Councilmember Balducci provides an opt out for communities. Simply put, the county won't site in your city if you opt out. Remove that protection through passage of I-27 and the public health officer can site it wherever they want. I-27 was crafted by the Republican Party based on polling so it could be used as a wedge issue. The irony is passing I-27 removes the one obstacle to siting an injection site here.

0.0,"The US Constitution grants Presidents broad power to hire and fire FBI directors, but Federal Law still applies and can be at the same time violated under certain fact patterns, specifically for obstructing justice, and for the same action of the President firing his FBI director. Thus, while a President has the Constitutional right to fire an FBI Director, he may, under certain circumstances, be obstructing justice in so doing. I'm not saying that this is or isn't the case here; just that this point is overlooked in this article. Also, what civil liberties are at risk for protecting the people from Presidents obstructing justice? None. It protects the integrity of the Democratic system and provides a slight disincentive to Presidents who might be inclined to give into such obstructionist behavior. There's a lot of Constitutional leeway there for sure, but it's not limitless. I believe that Trump's intent was to obstruct, but he out-clevered federal law using carefully vague language.

Multinational corporations, whether the parent company is based in the US or abroad, make decisions all the time about where to put the next manufacturing plant, research center or headquarters.  The US's current corporate tax rate of 35% puts the US economy at a serious disadvantage when almost all our trading partners have rates of 15% to 20%.  Get the jobs and wealth here!  Lower the corporate rate substantially  --- whether 15% or 20%.  Find sensible ways to raise revenues with other taxes, such as energy or financial transaction taxes, VAT, border adjustment taxes, changes to individual rates.  Profits held overseas produce no tax revenue.  Charge a much lower rate and bring the money home.  This will produce substantial one-time tax revenues and bring more wealth into the US.

It's tempting to say the alt-Right had it coming because they were expressing an opinion I disagree with, but the fact is that had the counter-protesters stayed home (or just on the sidewalk), there would probably not have been any violence.

And at the better privates, a strong focus on cultural and social capital growth.  Then Maggie and  Brooks ignore the other side. There was a time when a high school degree of no distinction (or even less) was sufficient to find a decent paying job with some permanence. Today, the BA is the new high school (or depending on program, community college). Even then, earnings are relatively static. Entry level positions pay less and are more likely to be precarious than in the past.  = a winner-take-all society which requires parents to invest ever increasing resources and vote for pulling up the ladder to ensure opportunity for their child. Heightened stress on children to perform at ever higher levels. A collective action problem that is systemic in origin.  Much of this is a US perspective, but the 'green shoots' are growing in Canada

And while that may be the case in small pockets I disagree.  To me, I think there are 4 easier explanations.  1 A seemingly normal, law-abiding citizen buys a gun and then, seemingly unpredictably uses it in a crime.  2 A person buys guns legally, commits a crime in which they would be prohibited from possessing a gun, keeps the gun through a number of different oversights and then uses the gun in a future crime.  3 A person who is prohibited from possessing a gun takes or is given a gun be an acquaintance who, otherwise, is a normal gun owner.  4 A person who should be prohibited from possessing a gun is able to buy one due to oversights.

And you write """"9 times out of 10 this is about a user group (hikers) not wanting to share space, nothing more. It's a """"we were here first"""" thing""""   That's totally incorrect.  I'd say the thing hikers want is to hike in peace.  The amount of trails that are hiker only is dwindling every day.

Voters who think like that will be quite at home in one of the plethora of black parties given that race is what appears to drive them. Intellectual acuity certainly is not a factor in their reasoning.  Could this have something to do with the fact that many of the black politicians in the DA have an overblown sense of self esteem and conceit that is now out of control.

Private benefit plans have helped offset the cost of public programs and serve other employer purposes, such as keeping employees and their dependents well and at work. Increasing business taxes for health and dental benefits will only serve to reduce employers' ability to continue coverage due escalating drug cost from expensive specialty drugs such as biologics. The insurance industry is unlikely to continue to provide risk protection for annually recurrent high cost drugs as incidence and expense increase with new medications. Provincial drug plans are also at a tipping point as cost thresholds are exceeded. These very same plans will however, become the fallback as more employer plan cost surpass their own thresholds with drug benefits either restricted or eliminated.  Be careful what you ask!

They gave me trouble a few times when I was quietly, legally fishing rural trout streams.  But the after-history of the Civil War is one of America's historical treasures.  No reprisals, no prolonged exclusion of the Confederate states from full resumption of political rights.  Slavery was ended and Negroes made citizens.  Reconstruction forced the participation of Negroes in Southern political life--often successfully--until they were excluded from it by abusive laws after Reconstruction ended.  The chapter that followed--over a century of segregation and black oppression--was a political failure of the whole nation.  But it was not some kind of extension of slavery; the Civil War survivors had little to do with it.

He asked the vendor how things were going,  perhaps not knowing Stuckart had shut down his  mill,  and Green Veneer was shuttered,  and the US Plywood site had been razed.  The vendor said that there is no work,  but there  had been a little improvement recently:    """"The crank  heads have left town because there is nothing left to steal.""""  When there is nothing left to steal,  the problem children will move on.  That is what you have to  look forward to.

0.0,"I fail to see how the VPSO broke the law based on this article.  Law enforcement carry loaded guns.  They can draw loaded guns, and it sometimes doesn't even amount to an arrest, much less an assault.  Law enforcement officers also have to protect themselves.  In this case, there were three people, with six hands that could have done almost anything, at an abandoned tank farm.  The VPSO had to protect himself.  In New York City, all three people would have been face down on the ground.  If any of them tried to get up, he would know he could be shot, without the police saying a word.  The VSPO here gave a verbal warning.  While excessive force should be against the law, I don't see that here.  Moreover, the charges here could have a chilling effect on VPSOs from protecting their villages by performing their duties and protecting themselves.  The article suggests that taking photos was improper.  To the contrary, police should be required to video and audio record their investigations.

As a result, first responders to Houston's Harvey lacked that crucial information when arriving at plants and factories awash with floodwater and likely were unknowingly exposed to air and water borne toxins. The impetus for the repeal was under the guise of elimination of imposition of government intrusion into private enterprise but when it comes to matters of public health and safety, such oversight should be mandatory, not optional and not be secondary to the pursuit of profit. On the anniversary of 9/11, it's entirely hypocritical to laud the noble and brave efforts of our emergency personnel while undermining the base protections which enable them to safely execute their duties.

We see it, for example, in Community Supported Agriculture, Food Pantries, etc., publicly witnessing inter-faith harmony in the practical collaboration of communal mutuality, complementarity and subsidiarity - one for all, all for one. Barriers to inter-faith harmony based on doctrinaire church competition are collapsing. The life and teaching of Jesus intend for practical living and not for political, ideological control. In a practical way, Christian attraction is authentic in terms of non-institutional, grass-roots Eucharist. Nature is first church, first sacrament, for her largesse resources and owns all life. Divine graciousness works in and through natural sacrament which transcends man-made constructs of institutional control and self-interest politics.

0.0,"I was once opposed to the concept of lot splitting, for similar reasons as some Edmonton residents express here.  But the City of Richmond BC, under pressure from developers, allowed new houses to be built almost to the side lot line,  and also allowed for massive set-backs.  These setbacks are popular for three car garages, and the City allows almost the entire front yard to be paved.  Now new build  homes dominate the lot.  The zoning for the property neighbouring us is  almost 5000 sq feet. It will sell for three million upwards. This is typical in the neighbourhood.  When completed, the house may be occupied for only part of the year, or not at all.  It is guaranteed to be under-occupied for the five bedrooms.  Far better that two homes be built.  There would be no difference to set-back or how far away the houses are to property lines.  In insisting that lots not be subdividable, Edmonton neighbourhoods should be careful what they wish for.

It isn't a personal failure, or a personal choice, at least my mother's alcoholism wasn't controllable. She crashed several cars, messed up several kids, and finally killed herself. Finally, my father just let her drink, unable to fix things, and sitting at a dinner table with her drunk was absolute agony.  Recovery is the biggest word in the English language.

And at least 90% of kids who took them left high school unable to have a real conversation in the language.  When introduced younger, language classes have much better results.  And immersion programs in elementary school result in bilingualism and billiteracy.  Of course, it has to be used or it will slowly fade.  Why should we do what we did 20 years ago if it didn't work?  And, what American kids are being hurt here?  English learners?  I also wonder if we're talking about the same thing.  I know at one point there was allegedly a program where the teacher would say something, translate it, say something else, translate.  That's not what dual programs are.  One language is spoken hours at a time.  Also, they're predominantly elementary school programs.  If a kid enters the school system at 16 speaking no English, that's hard, needs a different approach.

Trump's widely acknowledged propensity to change his position on a whim gives him an unusual amount of wiggle room for whatever policies his administration decides to pursue.

The media foolishly used Trump as an entertaining ratings raiser and simultaneously as a would-be scapegoat to make Hillary and the establishment look good. They gave trump a free ride at the front of the bus and also gave Hillary a free ride at the back of the bus. Both backfired. And when it became obvious Bernie Sanders was the most popular candidate in America, one who would have easily defeated Trump, they ignored him. The liberal establishment blew it. They and their middle class supporters deserve all the criticism they're getting and all the hand wringing they're going through.

So, if we acknowlege the messaging from the high horse does tunes consumers out and drives them to social media platforms we are left  with the fact that media as business entities have committed corporate suicide.

There are several ways to protect against this.  One of the ways in the article is to tie the revenue stream to high construction costs.   That is one of the reasons an optional property sales tax is proposed in the TOD Zone.  This tax would take time to get online, but once done can be significant.  That is why revenue options need to be in combination.  If more options come online, even the excise tax extension, with reduced burden, could be eliminated. Option 2 in the article. However the excise tax is powerful, because tourist share in the burden.  With increased visitor arrivals this is an important source.  With rail to Ala Moana, more tourists would use it, say to visit new TOD stops, or go to Pearl Harbor or Aloha Stadium.   Thanks everyone for comments.!!!  All needs to be addressed.

But it also requires a GREAT trust in the power of the Holy Spirit to inform the souls and consciences of all of God's people.  Too often, civilized bullies show up to insert their comments of distrust and the need to retract the splendid legacy of Vatican II.  This was first demonstrated by the hierarchy trying to reassert its papal and curial authority----first with the interventions of Paul VI [during the last sessions of the Council] and then, more systematically and harshly, by John Paul II, Benedict XVI and the reactionary bishops that they appointed.  There are also civilized bullies who appear on this site attempting to denigrate this Vision of Vatican II.  They're mere fumes from the sewers.

That would include military spending for which he sought increases, but was denied by congress or they were held up by the Sequester-- Trump is adding only 2-3 Percent to military spending requested by Obama. Military spending for some years under Obama will be bigger than Trump's because of the wars going on during Obama's term and the same thing could happen to Trump's spending. Per the Congressional Budget Office, Obama's large spending projects were his tax cuts totaling $855 Billion, and his ARRA stimulus package at $787 Billion. The net impact of Obamacare was zero because costs were balanced by taxes specifically provided for Obamacare (those taxes will be removed by Trump and expand the deficit).

In hyper-free-enterprise and expensive Hong Kong, one-third of housing units are provided by the government, presumably in recognition of the reality that the private sector has no real interest in serving the lower income population. Once a certain level of speculative valuation and income in the housing market is reached, there is no market logic to provide rental housing to lower and middle income earners via the private sector.

You and others like you either do not know or don’t give a rat’s arse about a document called the Constitution of the United States which establishes the separation of powers into three branches of government, legislative, executive and judiciary, and defines the roles of each.  The legislative branch (Congress) is responsible for making and changing laws; the executive (the President) is responsible for faithfully executing the laws and the judiciary (the courts) for interpreting laws.  If Congress does not pass a law requested by the President, so be it.  He cannot then “just do it” with an Executive Order as you seem to think.

Elder Wilson may sense that his frequent references to Jesus' immanent return needs the wrecking of the ecclesiology he leads to be confirmed.  Is it possible his authorizing withholding baptism to 100,000 Rwandans in order to attempt to baptize 100,000 people in one day was a pesonal effort to attract the attention of forces opposing the church?

Incidentally, religious rights do protect non-believers too or did you forget that non-belief was also once a heresy punishable by death.  Protection of religion is also protection from religion. It means, the state will not interfere in matters of faith.

The problem might lay with you, and the freedoms you consider disposable and a contempt for women's rights. People were protesting not because their side lost, but because of the freedoms that might get lost due to that election. They had every right to be concerned about losing their rights under a right wing govt with p$$y grabbing president.  I'm sorry if you're unable to understand that concept.

To sum up the ridiculousness of this situation, three men burst out of the bar, surprising a passing beaver, and instead of making their way home, decided to kill it.  They searched for a weapon ( a chair from the bakery next door), impaled/beat the animal to death and then cut off its' tail, likely for the $30 reimbursement  by the gov't's beaver cull program. They then stuff the body in the garbage can. The incident was caught on camera. Blood was on the ground. Photos were  taken of the scene and posted on facebook.

0.0,"Getting absorbed into a discussion about the causes of the hurricanes -- something that can be neither proved nor disproved at this point -- is a distraction from the real justice issue at hand, which is that disasters like these are hardest on those who have the least to begin with.  It's the inner-city poor in this country and those living on the margins in undeveloped nations like the Dominican Republic that are hit hardest and have the longest recovery when such events happen. It's not just poverty that is the issue, but the systems we all support (knowingly and unknowingly) that perpetuate poverty.  The coldest, hardest truth for Christians to own is that others pay a price for our comfort. Climate science may well prove to have a role in these disasters, but the science I'm most concerned about at the moment is the science of economics.

The key is the process by which that happens.  That process may well be what """"being church"""" is really all about.  It's the ongoing struggle, the consistent desire to find the best solution we can, learning from our mistakes, and in the process, building a trust in each other.  To get that """"best solution"""" will require that voices not be excluded, simply because of a person's gender, wealth or poverty, or status in the church.

Most Alaska readers know that their sport and commercial harvests are significantly reduced by salmon and halibut killed in your nets and then thrown overboard to feed the birds.  We are not sympathetic to your opposition to more targeted techniques, such as pots, which would virtually eliminate salmon and halibut bycatch - but lower your profit margin.

His Word is not open for debate it cannot contradict itself and must not be touched by man.  It is impossible for it to be God’s Word (Will) and not His Word (Will) at the same time.  You should ask yourself why two Popes forbade the teaching of the Divine Mercy Message (Image). Sister Faustina was very poorly educated and it is fair to assume that if her superiors had accepted her painting, as they should have done (they would have known that Gods Word is inviolate) she would have also. Earthly hands violated Gods Word to fit their own earthly vision of goodness, they could not accept the reality that they were been asked by God to show human weakness.  Continued

Young families will have to secure a large mortgage just so they can buy a place to live.  Getting indebted for such a large amount of money and at a longer time is not a great way to start out.

The notion of Merkel counting on him to keep the EU together is rather amusing. First, Merkel has never cared about anything but her own re-election though once back in power she has no other objective than a repeat. Her lack of direction and fortitude (forget the disastrous stunt of opening her arms to all the migrants of the world) have cost Germany in particular and the EU in general through the lack of sensible evolution, discredit to institutions and disastrous appointments.  The election of Macron may provide a period of calm till past the German election. Then pow! His objectives for the EU are inimical to Germany's interests.

0.0,"So you're proposing that the #1 value that all Canadians share, above all their freedoms and democratic rights, is that women should be encouraged to be in the public space? I suggest you're demonstrating two things. First, the near-impossibility of finding values that all Canadians share. And second, the incompatibility of your screening question with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  In Canada there are still many people who, though productive members of society, do not share the point of view you expressed. Furthermore their opinion on the matter is protected by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. So even though you and I welcome women in the public space, other Canadians do not and they're entitled to their views.  So you see, you haven't elucidated a core value. Your belief is not something that Canadians are obligated to hold. Please try again.

0.0,"All principles are general and can be open to interpretation.  On property rights, that essentially means one has the right to own, buy and sell property based on contract law and there are laws protecting it, but it does not mean one can do whatever they want with their property.  If one's actions harm others than that is definitely a reasonable restriction on property rights and that applies to all rights.  As for religious garb, I generally think women should be allowed to wear what they want where appropriate (A burqa in airport security or a bank is not appropriate), but at the same time some like the niqab and the burqa isolate one from society and more importantly Islam does not require women to wear them, only they dress modestly.  In fact during the Hajj, burqa and niqab are forbidden so its more cultural than religious.  In most majority Muslim countries you never see the burqa or niqab only is it common in a handful of them.

So some are doing great, as the investor class gets to invest in companies who are heartless in their desire to drive down wages and terrorize the poor workers. But there is no one to go to to beg for mercy. The barbarians delight in abandoning the poor, they call it instilling labor discipline. The barbarians live in palaces, the very poor become refugees in their own country. And of course, the professional political class allies with the professional media. Go Bernie.

Raising up the poor and the other is much more in line with the Kingdom of God that Jesus announced.  Ossoff should try to not sound like a cultural elitist.

He's getting money from Koko Head Stables because Caldwell screwed them over.  If Charles gets in they may keep/get some land.  Not because Charles gives a care about the horsies, but they gave him a modest contribution.  AND GOOD FOR THEM.  I'm all for it.  But Charles wants the money.  Same with Helemanu Plantation - although they gave a lot.  Same with one of the rescues that is getting zoning crap.

But the presentations cover many subjects and are not just dry recitations of established canon law but explore current society/culture, too, and speculate about change.  Two titles from 1970:  1) “Theological reflections on institutional renewal in the Church” and 2) “The creative canonist: his role in Church reform”.  Maybe regional conferences are dry lectures.

Tepees, in order to be warm and weather-proof, require animal skins: loads of animals roaming in herds AND the right to toodle around vast swathes of land hunting said animals -- neither of which requirements currently survives. Instead, the vast swathes of land were claimed by the Crown, and FN were herded onto reserves, their traditional practices outlawed, and their children taken away to receive an education that was intentionally shaped to un-FN them with contempt for, among other things, tepees. Plus, the reason for tepees is that if you find you're living in a place with unpotable water or not enough food or fuel, you can pick it up and move to a better spot. Moving is no longer allowed, and reserves were lands that no one else wanted, bad soil, whatever. On top of that, natural water sources were limited -- and on many reserves now have been catastrophically polluted by industry. In other words, we took away all the reasons tepees were good.

I merely was pointing out the reverse is currently true. Some states tax more, but those companies have the same price anyway. We end up paying a bit more (because companies factor in the various taxes when setting prices) but don't get taxes in return.  Not a fantasy at all.

Given the two premises above, there is no other logical conclusion.  Weather is never predictable, which is why meteorologists refer to forecasts, not predictions. There is always the influence of that unknown variable which disallows such certainty.  For the Christian, this is actually good news: the humble acceptance of vulnerability through non-omnipotence is an occasion for surrendering self to the divine will. When this is done, the role of chance in life is reduced, if not eliminated altogether.

0.0,"The federal debt is simply the total amount of money that the federal government has spent into the economy.  As the monopoly issuer of the US dollar, the federal government can hypothetically create and spend as much new money into the economy as it wants to.  As a monetarily sovereign nation, the US can never go broke unlike a private household, business, state or local government  or even a nation like Greece which gave up its monetary sovereignty when it joined the EU.  Furthermore, the federal government doesn't need to tax its citizens or borrow money from a nation like China to fund spending.  The debt ceiling is an arbitrary number imposed by Congress that acts as an unnecessary constraint to federal spending.  The only natural constraint to federal spending is inflation which is a result of a shortage in supply of a finite resource such as oil, food, cars or people (workers).   Our federal taxes keep inflation under control by removing excess dollars from the economy.

0.0,"The core problem is run away government spending that has produced public sector debt loads that would bankrupt the state if interest rates were allowed to rise.   Artificially suppressed interest rates also give people the perception of huge debt carrying capacity, which allows them to bid up the price of assets - around Toronto, that means housing. If the response is to effectively tinker with the housing market, the cheap money will just go and create a bubble somewhere else. Better to address the core problem - have our crazy government trim spending, and return the setting of interest rates to a market based system, rather than the object of Central Bank manipulation.

He is simply a savage who can read and write...Indian children should be withdrawn as much as possible from the parental influence, and the only way to do that would be to put them in central...schools where they will acquire the habits and modes of thought of white men."""" (from the TRC Report, page 2).

You can be reasonably certain that Clinton would appoint a justice favorable to overturning Gonzalez v. Carhart.  Why would you doubt that?

(they actually count the lifejackets)  With regard to SOLAS requirements, they pertain to international voyages, not domestic.  Even the Titanic took over two and a half hours to sink.  I think other ferries, CG vessels and local citizens could safely remove all passengers in in emergency.  I don't think a crew member would be nervous if you wore a lifejacket on board a ferry.  They might shake their head in disbelief though.  If  Mr. McKnight is so fearful of riding a ferry, maybe he should drive around the next time he has to go to Seattle.

Unlike in other years, this year has spurred a vibrant opponent to Slom in the form of Stanley Chang. Stanley, being the campaigner, has in many ways re-written the """"how to go from Zero name recognition to being elected"""" manual when he ran for City Council. He's using that same playbook again, and will visit the thousands of houses he mentions in this article.  Another difference is the vibrancy of the current office holder. Just putting it out there that the energy he brought to his first, and subsequent runs is greatly toned down in this race. Nuf said.

She had been dating him for a month and hadn't been intimate with him.  She had a couple of drinks with him and woke the next day with little recollection of the night, but with faint memories of him all over her.  They never dated again and a month later she found herself pregnant.  I told her to report it.  She said consent would be her word against his, and just wanted to abort the baby and the memory of it.  The other incident came from the other side.  A friend of a close friend of mine told us this story.  A week prior he broke up with a lady he gone on a few dates with, due to getting the feeling she was unstable.  Soon after, he got a call from the police.  """"Did you date assault her"""".  On hearing him side he was told that she had previously claimed 2 other ex's had assaulted her.  Case closed.

The Church teaches that the only option open to a gay Christian is celibacy and if they should sin they are in exactly the same position as all of the unmarried, the sacrament of penance is available to them and in this regard, they are treated equally. For young Christian gay adults, the options appear to be stark, live a single celibate life. As Christians we consider this to be a gift from God. Obviously Homosexuals have the same needs as heterosexuals for a loving sexual relationship, to impose celibacy upon any one, either a heterosexual or a homosexual person would create an intolerable situation within their heart, which would only serve to increase the desire for companionship and sexual intimacy...  http://www.v2catholic.com/background/2015/07/2015-07-25Kevin-Walters-a-bond-of-Divine-Mercy.htm kevin your brother In Christ

A reassessment of the property tax can only be made a) when the property ownership changes or b) there is construction done.  Practical experience, my folks bought a house near Santa Monica in 1972, for about 70k.  In 1978 it was probably worth about 100k, but Prop 13 valued it back in 1975, so maybe 80k.  Yes there have been tiny inflation adjustments, but their house is now worth the north side of 1.5 million.  Not sure on the exact number, but their property tax is about $2000 a year. Compare we had a house in San Diego, bought in 2006 for about 600k, our property taxes were about $6000 a year.  Great for my folks, but not fair in a macro sense.

Giving up Gaza only made for a larger and more concentrated area for their enemies to launch rocket and other attacks against them.  Israel will give back the West Bank at about the same time the citizens of the original 13 colonies give back the land they stole from the native Americans,  King George and the Loyalists sent to Canada and England.

That doesn't mean that the lowest paying jobs should not provide a living wage. As long as big corporations are allowed to pay less than that, we, the taxpayers will be subsidizing them through food and rent subsidies financed by our taxes. CEO's who make hundreds of times more money than their low wage workers (and who have had their taxes reduced regularly) are one of the reasons that poverty is increasing so much. They should at least pay a fair share of taxes. Their corporations could receive tax breaks if they pay living wages, but they should be heavily taxed if they don't. Those taxes could go to pay for projects that provide necessities, such as food, clothing, and shelter, to the needy.

Are they surprised to watch Trump nihilistically tear down a century of progress, upset, or in a state of denial? Who knows.

Have Siemian practice more throwing to Charles and CJ in the flat.  Get a blocker in front of either guy and that's a first down. There are a lot of ways to work around a defense stacked for the run.

Trump has said extremely sexist things, and anyone who thinks they treat people fairly should be offended by the diminishing sexist comments he's made. He has also rallied against planned parenthood which receives federal funding and is a vital resource to women's health (and no, it's not just an abortion factory which the right keeps trying to paint it as).  From a cultural perspective I think it's important to speak out against the blatantly sexist things Trump has said and to be very diligent about legislation he may block or pass that affects women's rights.  For the most part this is about ideas - not so much about specific legislation. To think that his actions should dismiss his rhetoric isn't logical. You can't dismiss racist comments just because someone hasn't enacted racist legislation for example. It is what it is.

Our alternatives/preparations are:  -get the pipelines started ASAP so we can ship our oil somewhere else. -prepare our own wish list -make a separate deal with Mexico -go around Ross and talk to the states most affected by any blockage of trade between Canada and the US. -make changes to our dairy and poultry sectors to reduce the incentive for the US to demand access (ie cut price supports down to market levels) -prepare our own list of countervieling border taxes that we will impose if the US refuses to make a reasonable deal. -inform Mr Ross that if NAFTA is canned we will insist on reinstating the Canada US Auto Pact.

Admittedly, I could only read the title and the first paragraph, but if this article ended anywhere near where its premise began, it's filth. I used Wind Mobile in Calgary & Edmonton from October 2014 until June 2016 when I moved to the US. Over the almost 2 years I used Wind, I saw the call/coverage/data quality increase several-fold. By early 2016, Wind was faster than what I had experienced with Fido before I left that company in 2014 due to $80-100 phone bills. With Wind, I was paying about $45-50 to get unlimited everything in Canada and the US, and rarely had any issues streaming the most data-intensive content.  So I guess that's where my frustration with this article is coming from, is that someone is putting Freedom on blast in 2017 after several further network upgrades.

The Canadian role is rarely mentioned, and the photographs all show soldiers in American uniforms, which is what the Canadians wore on this invasion. - Thus, because of this Canadian force, the last time the US was invaded by foreign soldiers was not in the War of 1812 by British soldiers, but rather in WWII by Canadian soldiers on Kiska.  Yes, they were friendly soldiers, and invading by invitation, but they were still foreign soldiers.  See if you can win some bets with that one.

He removed AHC premiums and dozens of user fees, took provincial tax revenues down by at least 30% over his tenure, etc.  Notley has the opposite problem. She has to ramp normal sources of revenue back UP, to replace failing resource revenues, and to get the province back onto a more normal course. Klein faced growing resource revenues. Notley faces declining resource revenues. Klein had an oil industry in expansion, with projects that could break even with $26/bbl oil. Notley has an oil industry in stagnation and larger projects that need $95/bbl oil to be profitable. Klein led a province with 2.5M people, Notley leads a province with 4.5M people.

Research from pharmaceutical companies is notoriously unreliable. These are the same companies who sold us herion as a safe alternative to morphine and OxyContin as an addiction free drug for pain. After 30 years in the field of addiction treatment I continue to be amazed at our naivety. Suboxone is expensive, more difficult to stop using then heroin, will get you high, has a street value and can be sold to supplement welfare and social security. In my experience Suboxone users relapse in similar frequency to others and unless we want a medicated society controlled by Big Pharma we need to have more research into non-pharmaceutical interventions. This reasearch is not being conducted on the scale necessary to fight against unethical research, the propaganda of Big Pharma.

We're still using about half of the thermometers we used to use, and nearly all of them that were in the country in the past have had cities grow up around them with paved roads and buildings that store heat and warm the nearby air by an average of 3-degrees more than in the surrounding countryside.  An honest observer would move the thermometers to the countryside and away from the cities like they used to be, in order to make the data consistent.  But, of course, that wouldn't push the agenda, would it?  If you can't convince people it's warming, the funding gets shut down.

No one I know of has ever suggested that ordination of women as physicians would be inappropriate. Thus, let's narrow it down to ordination of women to the gospel ministry.  Two of the three groups within TOSC came to the conclusion that being male was a biblical requirement for the type of leadership that the discussion over ordination concerns.  It dawned on me this week that actually the third group probably does as well. If saying that women can be ordained requires a departure from a literal interpretation of the Bible, as some WO proponents are reported to assert, then that is an admission that the Bible prohibits it.  Thus, it seems that your statement is false.

Even worse, a lot of them may be foreign buyers who aren't spending the profit back into our economy. On houses lived in that are principle residences there are so many fees and taxes associated with moving that it is also ok to not pay capital gains or income tax - however, second properties should be strongly enforced.

0.0,"Because she sued for wrongful termination on the basis of gender discrimination (and retaliation), she apparently alleged that whatever insubordination reason the Church claimed to fire her, it was really based on the fact that she was a woman.  So, the most obvious example of that would be that she became pregnant out of wedlock, and the Church fired her.  Another example could be that she was fired for overtly complaining (perhaps to her students) that she wanted to be a priest but the Church wouldn't let her, but I can't imagine a lawyer taking such a case as a gender-discrimination claim, because a man could have made the same complaint about the Church's teaching on women priests.  Maybe she was dressing with her cleavage showing, but that's a very weak gender claim too.  If she were married and the Church fired her for being pregnant, then the ministerial exception clause is unfairly depriving her of a legitimate claim, and the Court is wrong, imo.

The rest of Canada will catch up eventually.  Jagmeet cannot be a socially progressive person if he condones the practice of women  to be kept in shadows in CANADA for child bearing purposes and  not socially contributing as scientists, engineers, etc. A terrible waste of human resources for the good of the country.

In some early traditions, Christ is entirely a supernatural being who never actually descends beyond the lower regions of the firmament, where he does battle with evil forces and ascends back into the upper regions, the Seventh Heaven, and so on. On the other hand, there were probably a number of actual wandering mystics in the period and scriptural Jesus could be a composite of some of them. I don't think the historicity of Jesus is ever likely to be conclusively settled, though some Biblical scholars are convinced by the rather scant mentions by Roman historians it strikes me as quite thin. As a movement, I think Rome eventually adapted to Christianity rather than the other way round. It's elevation of the low and downtrodden was a powerful subversive message in a society largely composed of slaves.

It used to be what we routinely prescribed to people as the solution for racism and other 'isms'. Pointing out that even native writers struggle to bridge historical divides to accurately capture native life in previous generations, given how different their modern life is? How is that controversial?  Punishing him for making those opinions known in his essay most definitely impacts his freedom of expression.

The predictable--the utterly foreseeable--result of withdrawing healthcare from many of the millions of people who obtained it by way of the ACA will be an increase in the number of both direct and spontaneous abortions, increased infant mortality, more deaths from complications of childbirth, and death and illness spawned by lack of medical care and inadequate nutrition. Pro-life? Absolutely not. Her pro-choice voting record and policies notwithstanding, Clinton---by way of her advocacy for expanded health care for women, children and infants--has done more to reduce the number and the rate of abortions in this country than Trump ever has or ever will. Supporting Trump on """"pro-life"""" grounds was naive at best.  More often, it seemed to be a cynical and hypocritical rationale for voting for  a manifestly racist, fascist candidate.

The addition of that Civil War symbol to state flags was an act of defiance. If a statue sits on private property, it is the right of the private property owner what to do with it. Period. If a statue is on public property, the locality in which it stands ought to hold a peaceful public debate. I think moving the statues to a central park or outside a museum would be one solution.

The fund has also paid another nearly $200,000 to lawyers for the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. If you donated to the Republican Party, ...you're footing the bill for traitors. Winning.

0.0,"I always thought the desire for the 'highlight of the night' hits killed hockey, and ended many careers.  The large majority of those hits reflect the ethos of football, which is a game of yards.  You have to prevent forward progression down field.  Hockey is about possession, and the rule book used to reflect that.  When I played, charging was more than 3 strides into a hit.  Hammering someone into the boards was, uh, boarding.  Now penalties seem predicated on the damage inflicted. If the NHL just enforced charging and boarding, added a 'dangerous play' major for the players who choose to flatten another who has his head down,  instead of making a play for the puck, they could eliminate many of the dangerous hits.  But the NHL is a business, and as long as they insist on winning the American viewer i.e. compete with the NFL, they will not change.   The owners want those highlights, and players will remain the replaceable slabs of meat they currently are.

It reduces the risk of harm due to the accident. Wearing or not wearing a seatbelt does not alter the underlying risk or make me more prone to accident  Locking my door does not prevent a robbery. It serves to prevent a specific type of robbery - but does not prevent all robberies.  Can you point to any other situation where the device used to mitigate the risk is directly tied to or source of the risk? We don't mitigate the risk of an oil spill by spilling oil. We don't mitigate the risk of a car crash by crashing a car. Yet we encourage people to mitigate possible instances of violence, often perpetrated with guns, by carrying that same device as the mitigator?

But do those substantiate a legal action?  I bought a car and it's a lemon should there be recourse?  I had sex and it was lousy and I feel guilt and shame should there be recourse?  The police should not be asked to be relationship counsellors, mental health professionals, anti-terrorist experts etc etc when people themselves refuse to accept that they make decisions and those choices have consequences.

Also you  might want to be careful what you wish for because if  Senator Wielechowski prevails, how long until the state government is forever obligated to spend by inviolable state statute that trumps the Constitutional separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches?

The endless Trump attacks are because he foiled their plans to grease their palms.  The media especially are ruthless and untrustworthy, and Canada's can be included in that.

I voted for a Walker and generally agree with his agenda, but he is dead wrong on this one. I think Clem Tillion said recently to leave the PF and PFD alone, there are 49 other states that deal with their budget without a permanent fund to fall back on. We all (including Governor Walker) need to ask ourselves, how would we do this if we didn't have a PF bail to us out? I don't have an answer to that question, but I can say with certainty that Alaska wouldn't cease to exist because we didn't have a PF. Walker and this oil soaked legislative majority need to stop trying so hard to appease the oil companies and start doing the job that they were elected to do, represent us, the people.

I've tested many different scenarios of winter tires over the years because I love driving year-round.  I find that a good set of stud-less winter tires with a narrow profile (while maintaining stock diameter of the tire) provides very good traction overall.  In deep snow the narrow profile cuts through the snow like ice skates providing very good directional stability.  The narrow profiles will cut into the soft snow pack instead of floating like wide tires and reach hard pack quickly for better traction. On ice they are as good as studded tires!

And then I found it.  The PBO (along with Trudeau) included the assets of all public pension plans (including CPP) as government assets.  Sorry, but these are not assets of the government, they belong to the people covered by the pension plans and cannot be used by the federal government.  They should not be included My analysis shows that after Harper put us into a structural surplus Trudeau put us into a structural deficit.  Between 2015-16 and 2016-17 government revenues fell while expenses soared.  Clearly, if revenues are falling and expenditures are rising during periods of economic growth, what sort of mess will Canada be in during the next recession, and there will be one?

I want teachers for my children that are fairly compensated, don't have to worry about benefits, and feel valued enough to provide students with the best they have to offer as a result.  Growing up in Soldotna, I had teachers that also taught my mother and my aunts and uncles.  They made a lifelong commitment to better the children in their communities and that means something.

0.0,"True, Sher, the world price of oil 'tanked' when Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister, Mr. Al-Naimi told a meeting in Houston, Texas, three years ago that the price of oil was artificially high. He said, """"Inefficient uneconomic producers will have to get out."""" OPEC refused to cut production of its light sweet crude because """"Cutting low-cost production to subsidize higher cost supplies only postpones the day of reckoning."""" Saudi oil is easily accessible and uses conventional processing involving boiler and distillation processes to achieve streams such as gas, NAPTHA, waxes, gasoline, kerosene, diesel, etc, and the final residual is asphalt or bitumen used for paving. Upgrading 'reverses' that process, adding heat & diluent (eg, NAPTHA) to make the sludge flow, prior to upgrading. Most world markets are not importing diluted bitumen (dilbit) for upgrading at this time. Saudi Arabia added 'renewable energy' to university engineering programs and its Energy Dept.

If immigration trends continue  Ontario will be home to over half the nations population. Central Canada already has most of the political and banking   power. Canada will not survive if power is centralized between Montreal and Toronto and based on immigrant populations. The rest of Canada including the Maritimes produces the food and resources that Toronto consumes but we are considered welfare bums and whiners. Our national media including the CBC is little more than the world according to downtown Toronto and many of our politicians are ignorant beyond belief and do not know anything outside Ottawa or their riding.

It's a classic example of how the media purposefully brushed all the Democrat's dirty tactics under the rug and the frustrating double standard offered to the left.  Could you imagine the outrage if Republicans invoked violence at Democrat rallies?  What about the millions that poured into Canada from international foundations to support the left leaning political party's agenda in advertising against the Conservatives and provincial PC's?

Well doctors do save lives, but so do nurses, firefighters and EMS workers, and the police, but dollar for dollar the latter pay more taxes than doctors. Secondly, for business people the reward for their risk should be what the market pays them for their success and not through the tax system. Many pundits talk about the relative security of the salaried employee vis a vis the independent business person. Well unless you are a civil servant, that relative security is just another myth.

The invoice said if I couldn't rate the experience as a 10 out of 10, they considered it a failure. Not wanting to jeopardize my warranty I elected not to fill out either survey.

He's a very good speaker, but at some points in his logic he opts for simplicity where nuance would have put him closer to reality.  To use a metaphor, Isaac Newton's view of the world relies upon the simplifying assumptions that space and time are absolutes.  It turns out that while these assumptions make good sense in most circumstances, they don't work for your GPS devices.  You have to use Einstein's field equations for the GPS system to work.  Similarly, the Church's teaching relies on the assumption that there are only men and women.  While that is mostly true, reality is more nuanced.  To give the most dramatic example, one in 20,000 men are born looking like a woman because a particular gene is missing.  Gender is even more genetically complex, and this affects the """"orientation"""" of one in every twenty-five people.  I wonder what Fr. Scalia's talk would look like if he updated his facts.

Then again most advanced industrialized countries have some form of universal health care that includes treatment for mental illness as well as far greater restrictions on firearm possession.

He made it clear to the hierarchy that the center could only help priests with substance abuse problems, or sexual problems involving adults. He also made it clear that his center could do nothing with priests who abused children and teens. He informed the bishops that all studies showed that such abusers could not be cured but had to be removed from contact with children and youth. The priest was relieved of his directorship and replaced by a layman with a counseling degree who assured the bishops that child abusers could be cured.  It is often said that priest celibacy is not an important determining factor in child abuse. I tend to agree. BUT celibacy caused a reduction in the number of priests and made the bishops desperate to hold on to any priests they had. And we saw what happened when they kept priests just to keep their priest numbers up and thus look good in Rome. They """"pastored"""" only to Rome.

From there, we then have medicare for old folks, and medicaid for those with less than a set amount of income. Likewise, we require that families MUST INSURE their kids, or have less than a certain income to have medicaid for them. Beyond that, let private insurance handle the more long term stuff. Then we will have to decide if we go with mandating that ppl either have private insurance, have enough money to cover their own (say multi-millionaire).

With our recent interventionist history that level of isolationism seems incomprehensible. Many factors contributed to that isolationism-- our disillusion with the results of WWI;  desire to have nothing more to do with European problems; sympathy for  Nazi Germany from both German-Americans and native fascists; organized pacifism from both religious and ideological reasons; and failure to understand the nature and danger of Naziism. Socialist Norman Thomas dropped his pacifism only when he understood their horror and power.

It's only then that our Greatest Generation jumped in to action and they didn't quit til it was over.

Gross misbehavior or illegal activity does not necessarily ensure speedy termination. The impediment to removing incompetent employees is finding supervisors in the chain of command with the fortitude to act on unacceptable behavior. In the lower ranks of management virtually all the supervisors are promoted from union jobs. Their hearts and minds are not necessarily attuned with accountability. Many union contracts have reversion clauses that allows supervisors to return to union jobs. Not many supervisors will offend the union on the possibility that they may become a member again But even more importantly, in public sector jobs accountability and efficiency are dim concepts. Public sector supervisory promotion is rarely correlated with improving productivity or getting rid of deadwood employees.

This is my comment to the article, as you obviously didn't read it: 'Rebecca, DM [and] media mentions in passing the city has mismanaged the matter. Why not explore this in depth - the competencies of key people and their decisions or lack thereof since last year. You quote government saying they helped the city. Re. SAA, Dudu Myeni's competence was scrutinised. This is more serious than that and SOEs. Why did this go wrong? BTW I think Maimane is shifting blame about alleged price-rigging. It's more likely companies found the city's conditions too onerous and declined.'

If I get pulled over, get out of my car, put my hands up and start walking towards an officer, at some point I am going to get too close and get shot. That is just simple logic. If I disobey the orders and do something stupid, well, that's what I get. Personal responsibility for decisions made should be front and center here.

Although Lord Macartney did not leave China with his tail between his legs, the purpose for which he entered failed miserably which meant grave consequences for both countries.  China lost the opportunity to enter the Industrial age, and Great Britain suffered a loss of integrity.

Dark water absorbs 90% of the sun's heat.    Without the real number of how much reflection is lost and how much heat is retained, the information loses something.    It is typical in our earth-destroying culture to frame things this way.  Especially when the information is coupled with news about the luxury cruise through the arctic.

Some tell me to fully charge the battery prior to storage and check the battery every 3 months and recharge the battery if required. Some tell me to put on a battery maintainer with a trickle charge at all times. Some tell me to put a timer on the battery charger to charge the battery for an hour everyday. I would really like to know what I should do to have the battery last as long as possible. Thank you in advance and kind regards, Steve

0.0,"1. Too many elected employees (politicians) have succumbed to lobbying from the collection industry and mandated public institutions move collection to for profit companies which then tack on a lot of fees, 2) too many debtors avoid communication with those that hold their debts for months (or years) which lets fees accumulate and reduces the interest of debt holders to work something out and 3) the late fees/collection fees/interest rates are too high. If people on both sides of the transaction would be more reasonable the only ones losing big would be debt collectors. High fees & interest often result because of the need for debt holders to make up for money they never collect. Even for people not delinquent but carrying balances on credit cards, look at the interest rates: banks pay 1% for money you keep in savings, charge 15% - 28% or more on credit cards independent of any late fees.

I am an atheist but Canada unlike the US has not constitutionally entrenched the separation of church and state.  There are no clauses in our Constitution Act of 1867 and we have no counterpart of the First Amendment of the American constitution.  Our constitution actually mandates state funding of """"separate schools"""" (Catholic or Protestant minorities only not other religions) in several provinces and that is constitutionally valid.  That would be anathema in the USA.  See  Adler v Ontario (AG), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 609  In fact as PM Harper correctly noted in an interview several years ago the separation of church and state is an American constitutional concept and does not apply to the Canadian constitution. He went on to say that separation of church and state in Canada has meant, traditionally, that the government will not interfere with religion.

I have asked you several times about how Aurora's growth has decimated the rural populations and about investing and improving the rural areas so they can contribute more but your only answer is that rural areas get more money than urban. 15 acres may not be a lot but where do we stop? If it is beneficial to Aurora to turn all of Eastern Colorado into one huge dam is that also 'worth it'?

We also found that it was common for authors who had FCOI relationships with drug companies to recommend as first-line treatment medications that were manufactured by those drug companies. When authors were on more than one guideline, it was also common that they disclosed different FCOI in each.

Neither was the invasion justified by modern standards comparing similar events. Example: the UK didn't invade Ireland because of the IRA, despite a hundred years of bombings and terrorism. And finally, it wasn't justified on humanitarian grounds. Despite having absolutely nothing to do with 9/11, tens of thousands of Afghan civilians died due to the American invasion and occupation.

The wannabe terrorist sped off and was quickly prevented from another vehicle attack by a massive response by the police.  I believe much can be learned from this incident.

I have worked with plenty of women who were excellent in various IT roles and who thrived and worked in higher positions than I attained so there are most definately good jobs available for women who desire to work in the field. I don't see discrimination in this field at all. Having said that, I DO think that in general, there will always be more males than females in IT because more males are interested in IT. Same with the car industry. I have known many women who LOVED cars but in general, far more men are interested in cars than women. That's just a fact. The main thing is that if a woman would like to work in ANY field that she have no barriers in her way to do so (other than the merit/qualifications/personality/skills obstacles that all of us must deal with). The same for men. Equality does not mean the same. Thank you for having the guts to point out the obvious Ms. Soh.

Is he guilty of being a jerk in the Court of Public Opinion? Absolutely. That means absolutely nothing to OAR, nor should it. Colorado Rules of Professional Conduct deal with, and with no shortage of specificity: how attorneys are to confer and communicate with each other, how attorneys must communicate with their client, how attorneys must communicate with an opposing party not represented by counsel, and the protocol for comporting with courtroom-specific behavior. The flipping off of a reporter, though morally improper, is not per-se (it's protected speech) obscene; hence there is not even 'moral turpitude' issue that OAR could assume any jurisdiction over to even begin an investigation. Had the attorney made the gesture in court, that's a different story, as the threshold for contemptable civil obscenity is lower.

Islamic extremists perceive, correctly I think, that the flood tide of western materialism is undermining their """"old-time religion"""" as relentlessly as it has undermined classic Christianity. The right-wing Christian extremists that are found mostly in the US have much the same perception and motivation. They see their religion, their culture and their whole way of life being eroded by secularism and tolerance of difference; where they can get control of the levers of government they react oppressively; where they are kept out of formal power, they react violently.

Again, most folks don't plan ahead for the more expensive consumables.  The other issue is that on average, a new vehicle is kept less than 4 years.

Hospitals and physicians got reimbursed dollar for dollar for the actual costs incurred in providing services to program patients.  Like every government program, the spending got out of hand due expansions and overuse.  To get it under control,  program administrators started to artificially squeeze down provider rebursement over the decades.  Somewhere, probably in the late 80s, the amounts paid by these programs did not cover the providers' actual costs.  The providers responded by increasing the standard rates to make up for the losses.  Private insurers knew that providers preferred non-government patients, so started to negotiate discounts.  Providers agreed, for the most part, as long as they covered their actual costs.  And here we are today, with the high standard rates.

The district sees students as general numbers, not individual needs of students based on behavior or IEP supports needed; and collaboration with city wide teams is necessary if we are to keep youth off the streets, away from drugs.  Poverty in education is a very big deal right now.  And previous leadership knew that smaller classrooms was on ballet, but not having budget plan in place to deal with that? That is why we are here now.  Looking at 20% budget cuts 2 years in a row.  And why the taxes of our middle class weight carriers or rent payers or teachers are getting grumpy.  What is so awesome about Dr. Watts is the fact he is not pacifying the problem, but addressing it.  He isn't ignoring it. He is dealing with it; keeping us all informed.

She was fine at bedtime, and 3 hours later 105 and climbing fever, barely walk, shaking, clammy, hallucinating, incoherent, vomitting, severe migraine, in tremendous pain, weak and I was terrified. 3 am in the ER and being told they need to take her cerebral fluid to test for meningitis. She had viral meningitis and other undiagnosed illnesses they still don't know what all she had. Thank God we are 10 minutes from the hospital and they have a wonderful ICU staff who took amazing care of her. She was a very sick little girl and we have no idea how she got sick. We don't know anyone who had been sick, no one else in our family got sick. I took care of her and slept in ICU for a week, so even with very close contact and body fluids I never got sick. So simply being around someone doesn't necessarily mean you are at risk. I can't imagine suddenly losing a child. I recommend spinal taps if Doctors think your child could have meningitis.

You mention failures in the Lower 48, but the reality is that wildlife populations down there are doing great and being harvested sustainably. Whitetail deer, black bear, and grizzly bear numbers are the highest they have been in a hundred years.  Overpopulated even!  Also, the money that sport hunters spend on licenses and gear (Pittman-Robertson Act) goes right back to conservation efforts, habitat improvement, and acquisition and protection of lands for wildlife habitat.

But instead he needs to pay for tax cuts to the 1% and what better way to do it than make sure federal employees are just as screwed as non-government workers, rather than lifting non-government workers back up.

Although it is currently described as an unlawful act, there is no sanction prescribed and is effectively a law without teeth.  Multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extremely drug-resistant (XDR) TB is the cause of a number of deaths daily in South Africa.

I never even touched the substance use and abuse by public assistance recipients.  These are all incentives that should be used to get these guys off the streets and into shelter and programs.  It's not the state denying them of these benefits, but by their own denial to secure services to resolve their housing and substance abuse issues, there should be consequences towards their refusal.  Right now the homeless holds the TRUMP card whether they get treatment or go into programs, which renders State strategies combating  homelessness ineffective.  Nobody can and will convince me that these people on the streets are doing it without some form of public assistance.

Roman literature was written for the wealthy senatorial and knightly classes and reflected their beliefs and interests; ironically, most of the emperors were populists and relied on the Roman mob for their power.   Consequently, there was never much love lost between the emperors and the Roman elite.   If you wanted insult a Roman politician, you accused him of homosexuality and of incest with his sister(s) or mother.   There is just as much evidence that Caligula was an able administrator who took on some powerful vested interests as there is that he was some sort of perverted monster, but just as today, the elite got to write the history.

Doing so would also say, the needs of the abused come before Tradition and the canoncial requirement of  'priestly/brotherly' support.

One proof of that is to ask oneself if there has been a difference, for example, in the `news' being broadcast from CNN `News' compared to Fox `News' on President Trump.    Of course, the answer is yes, and I think this is a good example of Fake News.   The Media needs to be held partly responsible for all the hatred and division in America.   In the very least, a `News' media outlet should be broadcasting only factual occurrences under the umbrella of `News'.

Of not wanting to have to deal with the 'other'.  I don't think this is a white issue, but human even primal issue.  We speak more of white racism, because in first world countries white people are a majority, and thus wield more power - if roles were reversed, and some other racial group was in power and the majority, the racism we'd focus on would be theirs.  Recognizing this factor of human nature, and building in rules and controls against it so that people do not mistreat other people has been a huge step forward for western civilization.  And given time and a less divisive discourse, in the end the 'other' will be 'one of us'.

It went on to talk about lobbying efforts by big utilities across the US and then identified specific areas like Florida. I believe the documentary to be true and that not much has changed since it was produced.

It also serves as a wake-up call to young people, many of whom have been coddled by their parents and the educational system.

That increased traffic will also mean more air (and noise) pollution as those ships burn mainly cheap bunker oil, which will affect the general health of people living in the surrounding areas where those tankers are going to operate. As I wrote previously, shipping Canadian heavy crude oil to Asia or other foreign countries has been qualified as """"uneconomical"""" by most traders involved in that business.  Canadian oil producers can actually use U.S. port facilities to ship their crude oil to other countries (U.S. law allows for exports of Canadian oil as long as they aren't mingled with U.S. products). Around two million barrels of mostly heavy oil from Canada's oil sands have been exported from the U.S. Gulf Coast in 2014.

0.0,"The reason that stories like this one about predator-priest Kevin Gugliotta keep coming forward is that both priests and hierarchs CANNOT be publicly honest about their fundamental personal truth.  Not only are some priests criminal sexual predators, but most hierarchs and priests are overwhelmed with shame and guilt about who they really are as persons.  Hence, hierarchs invariably fail to excise these predator priests from the community because the hierarchs know they come from the same insulated celibate clerical culture that produced the predators.  Catholic hierarchs are dangerously alienated from and hopelessly irrelevant to the lives of the masses of the very people they are called to serve.  This is how the corruption and complicity begins.  This is why Catholics must have the courage to completely reform and renew the priesthood from parish to pope - hopefully before the Catholic community disappears at the end of this century.

The Boy Blunder is also unique in piously proclaiming in writing to his minsters that they all must be above reproach in terms of the reality and even the appearance of providing privileged access to the elite in return for the $50,000 - $120,000 raised at these fundraisers.  As well, Trudeau is  unique in lying about the whole thing, in changing his story to substitute a new lie for the previous lie, and in showing contempt of parliament with his ridiculous responses on this.

Also, your account won't be restricted until you've received multiple warnings.

I think Russian intervention in Syria to crush the killer rebels, aka in the democrat camp as freedom fighters, was the most humane possible response.  The rebels have killed and displaced far too many.  The Obama camp and Hillary actually supported the killers and enabled them to do all the human damage they did.
